After visiting the website, I click on sign up to get started. I sign up with my google account, which also gives access to my google calendar. I choose whether I want websites to be blocked, or just gentle nudges when I’m off track. I choose what kind of notifications I want as well. If I don’t use google calendar, I see that I can set up apple calendar to automatically import my events.
