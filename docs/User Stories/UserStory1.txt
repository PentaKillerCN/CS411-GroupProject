As a student, I want to be able to calm down and study when I have deadlines and exams coming up. When I had deadlines and exams but spent too long on some websites like Facebook, I could add those websites in the list of blocking sites to force myself to not enter those websites. Please refer to the “Log-in story” to see how everything is set up. Then, the website blocks me from all those websites until I finish my deadlines and exams and decide to remove them all from the blocking sites. For possible obstacles, refer to the “Potential Problems Story”.
