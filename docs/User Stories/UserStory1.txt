As a student, I want to be able to stay on track when I have deadlines and exams coming up. Please see the “ Log in” story to see how everything is set up. When I spend too long on Facebook, it sends me a reminder (could send sms, or just a popup). I decide to let it be in control of my sites, and now it blocks me from all social media if I have a deadline this week. For possible obstacles, refer to the “Potential Problems Story”.
