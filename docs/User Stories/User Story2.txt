As an office worker, I need to work efficiently on my projects and files before the due day. To set up my own profile, please refer to "Log-in story" for detail. Also, as blocking websites may not seem that helpful for me to finish my work sometimes, refer to "Potential Problems Story" to change setting. After work, if I do not want any notifications to disturb my life, I can simply tap no notification.
