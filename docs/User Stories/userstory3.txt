As a person searching for some information in search engine, sometimes I see some disturbing ad websites pop out when I enter some websites. If I do not want to see those ads websites, I can add them to the list of blocking sites. Please refer to the “Log-in story” to see how everything is set up. Then, the website would block me from those websites and become something like an ad-blocker.
