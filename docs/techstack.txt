We are using express, node, and html/pug so far, as that is what is generated by express-generator, and recommended by the professor, and honestly it's what we are most familiar with. There's not much justification beyond that, as our project should be achievable in other stacks as well. We started with just html/javascript, as the google calendar api actually provides very easy functions for this. But we aren't allowed to call the api on the front end, and for our other apis we will likely have to access them in the back end anyway.
