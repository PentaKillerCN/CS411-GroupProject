Primary Idea:
	With a personal profile, users can make their own calendars. According to the different important levels of
  upcoming events on the calendar, our planner will give users suggestions about how to plan their day before
  these upcoming events. With help from different APIs such as chrome and google calendar, our planner can prompt
  a message box during certain time period to help users make time management (with users’ approval). For example,
  if there is an upcoming exam, our planner will prompt a message box saying “you need to focus on your exam preparation”
  or something.

Secondary Idea:
	On some important dates, our website recommend different types of playlists, dresses, and places for users.
  For example, on Valentine’s day, users can go to our website and find love songs they would like to listen to, which
  can be romantic or sad. Also, if a user wants to confess his/her love, he/she can look up our website for places
  like restaurants that suit for dating and dress that is appropriate to go to that place. Or, if a user breaks up
  on Valentine’s day, he/she can find some places like bars on our website. On normal days, our website can also recommend
  different types of playlists, dresses, and places for users. For example, if it is a sunny day, our website would
  recommend some happy songs and some places like beach for outdoor activities or parties. Or, if it is a rainy day,
  our website would recommend some sad songs.
